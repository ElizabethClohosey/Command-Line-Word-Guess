//     Make constructor Word that depends on the letter of constructor.
//         - Array of new Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying Word
//         - function that returns a string representing the word (this should call the function on each Letter object) (random word)
//         - function that takes in a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (guess)
//         *** Will require Letter.js***
